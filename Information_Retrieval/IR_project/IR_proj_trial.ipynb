In general, Europeans are much more concerned with the digestive process than Americans.\",\n   'I\\'d like to take a different approach in answering this. I think geographical location and higher availability of other drinks probably is a bigger reason that water is not consumed as much by people in certain regions, including Europe. I believe and many visitors have commented that children drink less water and more soda in USA.  This is primarily due to the fact that soda companies advertise a lot, making it more attractive. Secondly, SODA IS ATTRACTIVE, and according to a few medical experts it\\'s even addictive (yes, caffeine is addictive to some extent).  . . Secondly the cold weather in upper northern hemisphere in general is more of a reason that ppl drink less water and more of other drinks.  For example if you are from a tropical country or from a very humid place, you would probably & naturally  be drinking more water rather than if you are from   a country like Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland.. . Another reason is that people being less immune to impure water (like tap water) and being more dependent on bottled water makes the water less affordable and less available.  If you need to pay  extra or need to work harder to get the commodity, you may resort to cheaper commodity or a near by commodity.. . Another reason I also feel is the commute using Cars rather than walking or cycling.  If you walk more to commute (like walk to train stations, walk a few blocks to get groceries, etc.) then you are more likely to drink water when compared to driving to every place you go and exert yourself much less.  In many other countries people walk, walk and walk for several small things.. . Lack of education and awareness is also a reason for not consuming enough water. Not many people (except for few educated ones)know that 80% of our body is water.  Even if they knew, ppl forget that fact easily and resort to \"other drinks\".. .

Most hybrids have battery packs which are charged by what is called \"generative breaking\".  Instead of slowing down with traditional braking, these cars store some of the energy from braking into a battery pack.  Then when the light changes and the car moves again, the energy stored in the battery can be used to move the car, or assist the engine in moving the car.. . In the city this effect can be more pronounced because of more frequent stopping and starting.',\n   'There are the two reasons mentioned already - using the energy from the breaks and using the gas engine only when it can work efficiently.. . One more thing to note is that for several cars, the hybrid model of a car has a smaller gas engine than the regular models (e.g. for Honda Civic the gas engine for the hybrid model is 1.3L, which is not available in the regular models).

I think it really comes down to what you're most familiar with. Personally, I never really got into PC gaming as heavily as I did console gaming. As such, I find a controller much more natural than a keyboard and mouse; much as I'd expect a PC gamer to find a controller awkward and clumsy.. . The keyboard and mouse have many a lot of advantages, and if you pitted a controller-player against a keyboard-and-mouse-player, the controller-player would be at a distinct disadvantage. . . All in all though, console makers and game developers have done a fantastic job of mapping FPS controls to hand-held controllers. It just takes practice. That and you may want to consider adjusting the look sensitivity for your controller.. . But I wouldn't worry too much. With the USB ports on the newer consoles that have hit (Xbox 360) or will be hitting (PS3) the market, you can expect to see some keyboards and mice coming out to appeal to PC gamers.. . As for the Nintendo Revolution's controller, I'm skeptical of how well it will work in practice. It's a great concept, but I think it will prove difficult to execute successfully enough not to become a niche feature. That, coupled with Nintendo's limited FPS library and lack of support from some of the industry's leading FPS developers doesn't give me an optimistic picture of the Revolution being the place to be in terms of getting an FPS fix.\",\n   \"Try inverting your controller if you haven't.

And because teachers are often comprised of persons with idealistic notions of helping people, and early childhood is the best time to begin that.\",\n   'The answer is fairly simple. As the educational system shifts from elementary to middle to high school, there is a shift towards a more subject oriented focus.. . Those teaching high school, for instance, are mostly trained in the subject areas that they teach. (i.e. mathematics, science, etc.) It is my belief that many who teach at the high school level do not initially intend to be teachers but to be professionals in their chosen field. The learning to \"teach\" is secondary to knowing the specific  subject matter. . . Elementary teachers, on the other hand, are those who know going into college that they want to teach.  They are, for the most part, female, nurturing individuals who want to work with children. The \"subject matter\" of elementary education is teaching methodology.  Much of the curriculum is rudimentary.  For instance, adding three digit numbers is not complicated, however, the teaching of it to young children is the art. . . Really the only other area of training focused on teaching is special education.  Those majoring in elementary education or special education do well by gaining degrees in each.',\n   'Many elementary education students, including myslef, go into elementary education to get their feet wet.  Once you get your degree in elementary education, you can try out teaching with younger students who are generally easier to manage.  This is especially the case of younger teachers who may be intimidated by highschoolers who are only five or six years younger in age.  After gaining some experience in education, it is easier to find your niche and what grade suites you.  . . Also, for some teachers, I think it is a matter of wanting to work with kids while they are still \"cute.\" Kind of like people who fall in love with puppies but don\\'t care for full sized dogs.  :-)',\n   'Well the subject matter is not eaiser, but often more interesting.

The result of not treating it swiftly can be deafness for the cat.. . I got my cat from a friend of a friend who owned a farm.  She was born there and probably spent a lot of time in the barn and outdoors in general. When I got her she had this black gunk in both her ears.. . I took her to the vet almost as soon as I got her, so I could get her shots and get her registered, checked out, and her checked out and find out anything I should know as a cat owner.  She was the first cat I had ever owned.. . He said the black stuff was ear mites and gave me some stuff for that.  I dutifully put that on her on my back patio in the mornings according to the directions that came with it.  The result was her ears got clean and stayed that way forever.  She suffered no loss of hearing as far as I can tell.  She comes when I call her name, just like a dog, in fact!. . My mom had a cat which she got from a shelter.  Eventually it passed on to my brother.  Before, it had been an indoor cat.  My brother decided it should be an outdoor cat.  At some point, the cat must have gotten ear mites.  Not sure if this was before anyone in our family had it or afterwards.  Whichever it was, the mite infestation must not have been caught and treated in time.  . . The cat is quite deaf.  It never responds when being called, even to look, when you are right there in the room with it.  It does not respond to loud noises at all, either.. . I know the annual checkups you take your cat to the vet for are kind of expensive but a big portion of that is for the shots, some of which they do not need every year anyway.  For example, my cat gets a 3 year rabies shot - so it does not need one every year.  So most years, the annual visit to vet is not as expensive as that one.. . If you are sure that the condition is caused by ear mites and you cannot afford to take the cat to the vet right now, at least get the medicine right away and apply it as directed.  I just looked, and PetSmart carries it.  There is probably a PetSmart near you and if not, it looks like you can order it from their web site.  It only costs $10.49 today.. . According to the second Source I have listed (kittencare.com) the mites could have moved from your cat to your house.  It sounds like they might move back again.  You might want to be on guard for that.. . I really encourage you to talk to a vet.. . Like I said, though both my cat and my brother's/mother's cat had the same condition - my cat has perfect hearing and the other cat is completely deaf.  The only difference was in the treatment they received.. . If you must skip the visit to the vet, or delay it, do not delay treating the ear mites at all!  Get the medicine for it and carefully use it as directed.. . Make sure you apply the miticide outside and make sure you dispose of whatever you apply it to your cats ears with outside as well.  Do not bring it back in your house to throw it away.  Do not wipe your cats ears inside. You might wipe the mites onto your floor and you really want to keep them outside.. . I am including a couple more links just so you will have more sources of information at your fingertips.  Might as well do all your research at once so you can act right away, without second thoughts or wishing you had more information.. . Good luck with the treatment and I hope your kitty gets well!. . The first step is spotting the mites and recognizing what they are, not just thinking it is dirt.. . You have done that, so now all that is left is the treatment and it is not hard to do.. . Make sure you hold your cat's head perfectly still while you apply the stuff.  Do not go in too far, either.. . She should be fine if you have caught the problem in time.\",\n   \"You could start with a simple ear cleaning--use warm olive/cooking oil.

The faster you go, the slower time goes for you. This effect is negligable unless you are going very close to the speed of light. In fact the formula is:. t'=t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2. where t' is the time that has passed from a stationary observer, t is the time that has passed for you, sqrt means square root and ^2 means squared. As you can notice, when v is small, since c^2 is so huge, you get a miniscule decimal, and 1 minus that number is basically as small as 1.0000000000001 or something, and so time is not really affected. As v gets larger(it can never be the speed of light, then the denomonator would be zero) that fraction becomes closer to 1, so when you subtract it from one, the denomonator gets smaller and smaller, meaning t gets smaller(in order for t' to remain constant) this means that time slows down for the object moving at such velocities! This formula is correct, it is part of Einstein's theory of relativity, and I have had to derive it myself from ordinary mechanics formulas. . . According to the same factor, length also contracts. It has been observed in certain tiny particles coming to the earth's surface. These particles have a certain lifespan before they become unstable and decay. They are also moving at a certain speed.

'Germinate' comes from 'germ cell' or the cell from where the whole organism grows. So whenever the germ cell is activated and starts growing into the new organism, it is germination. It usually refers to when the baby root and stem start to push out from the seed capsule.\",\n   'The purpose of laboratory testing of seed germination is to assess seed quality or viability and to predict performance of the seed and seedling in the field. Seed processed for sale must be tested by a qualified laboratory under the Association of Official Seed Analysts Rules for testing seeds. Several different kinds of testing are available depending on the type of seed to be tested, the conditions of the test, and the potential uses of the seed. The most common tests are the warm germination test, cold germination test, accelerated aging test, and the tetrazolium test. Each test is designed to evaluate various qualities of the seed. Factors that can affect the performance of seed in germination tests include; diseased seed, old seed, mechanically damaged seed, seed stored under high moisture, and excessive heating of seed during storage or drying. In most cases a seed treatment will improve germination of seed only if the poor quality is due to seed-borne disease. . . The most common test is a warm germination test because it is required by seed laws to appear on the label. The percentage of germinating seed in a warm germination test must be printed on the label of the seed if it is to be sold as seed. Germination is defined as: \"the emergence and development from the seed embryo of those essential structures which are indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions.\" The warm germination test reflects the stand producing potential of a seed lot under ideal planting conditions. Usually 400 seed from each seed lot are placed under moist conditions on blotters, rolled towels, or sand and maintained at 77 degrees F for about seven days. At the end of this period the seedlings are categorized as normal, abnormal, or diseased, and dead or hard seeds. The percentage germination is calculated from the number of normal seedlings from the total number of seeds evaluated. . . The cold germination test is designed to measure the ability of seeds to germinate under high soil-moisture content and low soil temperature. This vigor test simulates early season adverse field conditions and usually represents the lowest germination that would be expected from a seed lot planted under such conditions. Actual field germination would normally fall between the cold test result and that of the warm germination test. Seeds are planted in a sand-soil mix at high moisture content and maintained at 50 degrees F for seven days. The test is then placed at 77 degrees F for four days. The percentage of healthy seedlings that emerge at least one inch above the soil is reported. . . The accelerated aging test estimates the carryover potential of a seed lot in warehouse storage. The seeds are exposed to high temperatures and high relative humidity for short periods of time that cause seed deterioration. Seed are suspended over water in a chamber for 72 hours (wheat and soybeans) or 96 hours (corn) then tested in a standard warm germination test. This test only would be used on seed whose longevity was in question. . . The tetrazolium test is a \"quick test\" for seed lot viability. It is useful when an approximate germination percentage is needed immediately. Seeds are soaked overnight in water then treated with tetrazolium to give an indication of viable, abnormal, and dead seeds in the seed lot. This test will not detect seed-borne disease, thus is limited in its ability to estimate seed quality. This test is highly reliable for determining viable seed of corn, wheat, oats, barley, and other grasses. . . If growers wish to use bin-run seed and has not had a germination test conducted by a competent laboratory, they can get an approximate germination test using the following procedure in their own home. . .

This sort of depends on the bike...2 strokes are a little different than 4 strokes and I will address those separately.. . The key to break in on new motors is heat cycles.  New motors are not built with crappy tolerancing like older motors so your main concern is seating the rings properly.  This is done by putting the motor through a few heat cycles.  In race applications and when facilities are available, you would run the engine up to operating temperature and go full throttle through all gears then let it cool down completely.  This process would be done a few times.  The point is to put complete load on the engine when at proper operating temperature.  Remember, this is typical only for 'race' applications.. . For most normal users, you just ride it below the suggested rpm limit for a certain amount of mileage.  The theory is that this works similarly to the above.  You don't overstress the motor and you put an appropriate load on it.  It is good to vary the rpm during break-in.. . For two-strokes, you need to run a much more oil-rich mixture for proper lubrication.  After the suggested mileage, you can then switch the mixture to the normal ratio.. . Definitely, the owners manual will give you the 'recommended' method.  There is a lot of available data on why you break in motors in certain ways and why you don't.  The biggest concern is usually seating the rings so you don't get blow by.\",\n   'It depends on many things. First where you are riding the bike?

First, what is seen as the \"confederate flag\" is in fact NOT the confederate flag.  It is the Confederate naval flag.. . Now, most who feel that the confederate flag should not be shown is they claim it represents slavery.. . First, allow me to make clear WHY the civil war came about.. . It was over representation.. . At the time, there was a disagreement on how people should be represented.  One side wanted 2 representatives per state. The other wanted it based on population.  . . The north had a heavy industrial center, the south agricultural.  the decisions of a president can affect, for good or for ill, either side.  The states with heavy industry were more numerous, while agricultural had a large population.. . Here you can see why the issue on representation came into effect. It would determine if the US would be an agricultural, or a industrial nation.. . As an interesting note, Southern lawmakers wanted the slave population counted for representation and have voting rights, in an effort to secure their domination over the government.  The Northern didnt want that, for same reason.  This is where the idea that every 3 slaves counted as 2 people for the purpose of representation.  Eventually this wasnt enough, and civil war was fought.. . Why was the emancipation proclomation made?  To be able to free the slave population to fight for northern interests.. . . So what then, did we get out of the civil war?. . 1. The beginnings of true freedom for all races. 2. a house of representatives, and the senate. 3. a nation that is a mix of agricultural and industrial.. . Instead of concentrating on the issue of slavery, which existed before the war, we should concentrate on what the civil war taught us, and the good that came from it.. . it comes down to this... If the civil war never happened, and the south never seceeded due to differences in how representation should be done, would slavery ever ended?',\n   \"The confederate flag is all about context. Many Southerners would consider the flag a symbol of pride in the Southern way of life. Few outside the South recognize this, since many outside the South believe the Southern way of life involves inbreeding and missing teeth, which it does not. It usually involves Southern hospitality, REALLY good cooking (not necessarily healthy cooking), and in many cases a deep devotion to religious beliefs.. . If used in a hateful context, such as to celebrate slavery, the flag may be considered offensive, but it's display, to my knowledge, would still be protected under the First Amendment in this context.. . If used in a violence-promoting context, like encouraging revolt against the government or promoting violence against minorities, First Amendment protections may not apply.

Her name is Sandy (Sandy Lynn Sue, when she\\'s in trouble...LOL) She is a year old and very friendly. If you do not have a pit yet. Read all you can about the breed before you do. There is a lot of responsibllity in raising a GOOD pitt..   If this doesn\\'t sound like fun, perhaps. you should consider an older dog.. .  Any dog is a HUGE responsibility and a lifetime commitment. Please be prepared for. the role of responsible dog ownership before taking the step and buying a puppy, or adopting a dog. Unfortunately, many people put more thought into buying a car, or a major household appliance than they do when considering adding a dog to their home.. A dog will be in your home for a long time. A dog is not an item, or a piece of furniture,   it is a family member you are adding. Please do not take this responsibility lightly. Unfortunately, we have come to live in a time of \\'disposable\\' dogs, and people do not think twice before dumping, or abandoning an animal.  Be prepared for the role of RESPONSIBLE dog owner, and do not be a part of the problem.. . .  . Be Prepared for:.  . A few sleepless nights ignoring howling, crying & barking, until your puppy learns that this is his new home. . A lot of Carpet Cleaning, and wet spots. Puppies DO have accidents!! . A few damaged items around the house. Puppies DO chew, and are bound to damage/destroy at least one thing they were not supposed to have! . Babyproofing your home! Like a toddler, puppies find things that can hurt them!. You will need to hide wires, and keep potentially dangerous items like chocolates,. and cleaners out of reach. Adding a puppy is like bringing home a toddler, you MUST be prepared!!!! . Constant supervision. If you can\\'t watch your puppy, crate your puppy. A crate is NOT a prison. It is more like a \\'playpen\\'. Would you let your toddler stay home alone, or wander the house unattended?? . Boxer puppies can be particularly good at testing your patience. These are rambunctious, bold puppies who can be hard to tire out!! Some seem to be on the go CONSTANTLY. .  . . Also remember.......  . Puppies are much like babies. They need lots of interaction. If someone will not be at home most of the day, a puppy may be a poor choice for your family. . Puppies need to be taken outside many times during the day to reinforce housebreaking. You cannot blame a puppy for pottying in the house, if he/she isn\\'t given enough chances to \\'go\\' outside.  Adult dogs have better bladder control than puppies and can be expected to \\'hold it\\' a bit longer, and are more capable of learning how to \\'tell you\\' they have to go out! . Puppies need to be taught what is appropriate to chew on, and what is NOT an appropriate toy! Don\\'t give your puppy an old shoe and then expect them to know the difference between the old shoes and your new pair of $80 tennis shoes. . Puppies need to be trained. Your puppy needs your time, and your patience to learn how they are supposed to behave. With no socialization or training, your puppy may NOT grow up to be an ideal companion. This is NOT the dogs fault, but more so, the owners for not socializing or training the dog when it was young. . Do you and your puppy a favor. LEARN about training, and ask your breeder for help if needed. Many of the \\'old\\' methods of dog \\'training\\' do nothing but RUIN a good dog. \"Sticking their nose in it\" does MUCH more harm than good.

It's written in the style of a parable and is a short book I flick through every now and then to make sure I don't succomb to bad habits.  Two of the 'lessons' that stick in my mind are:. . 1. Pay Yourself First. Just as you pay companies for products and services, so you should pay yourself but before you pay anyone else.  In other words, as the poster above recommended, put some of your salary immediately (automatically if possible) into a savings account.  The advantage is that after a while you won't notice the drop in spending money and you'll feel so good as your pile of money grows.  Talking of which.... . 2. Make your money work for you. As you know, interest accrues on savings in a bank and after a while, interest will accrue on the interest you've already earned.  This is called compound interest and is extremely powerful but needs time to work.  Like a car rolling down a hill, it starts off slowly but eventually builds up speed.  More than anything, this is what is most likely to make you rich over time.  On the other hand, it can ruin you if you go into debt when compound interest works against you and you are charged interest on the interest of your original debt.. . So, live within your means, make it a priority to save or invest (sensibly) every month and allow your interest to gain interest on itself. Oh, and be patient.\",\n   'Go rob the Bank down the road from U',\n   'I recently read an article that reported on the independantly weathly people in America and how they got that way.  This article did not include people who are famous or got their wealth through big entertainment contracts or anything like that....it just reported on regular people that made millions and how they did it.  So this is what it said.. . They lived within their means.  When they began working, they budgeted their money and never spent more than they earned.  For example, they bought a car, kept the oil changed and all that regular check up stuff, and kept the car for as long as it was a financial asset.  They bought clothes, only what they needed, and kept those clothes until they no longer served the purpose they were bought for (ripped up, torn, stained beyond repair, etc...)  They bought a house, with land if able, and kept it.  Basically, they worked hard, spent ONLY what was neccessary to live, and saved the rest.  They didn\\'t buy things because they could, they saved instead.  Almost none of them owned a nice car or an expensive t.v. or a big, lavish home.  They all looked like regular people, clothes bought mostly from thrift stores or WalMart, t.v.\\'s under 25\" (and no plasma or flat screen either).  They bought food every week to cook at home (take out is too expensive in the long run).  They didn\\'t have hundreds of CD\\'s and DVD\\'s and didn\\'t have the high end stereo\\'s or surround sounds.  They worked smarter than everyone else, saving when others would spend.  They weren\\'t alcoholics or druggies.  They got good jobs with companies that offered good benefits and saved themselves for retirement.  They kept working until they were unable to anymore (and that was very few, believe it or not).  When they couldn\\'t work outside the home anymore, they worked at home.  They took care of themselves and didn\\'t do it by buying memberships to gyms or weight loss programs.  They did it the old fashioned way.. . So the end result is that over years and years, all the pennies they saved truly did add up to millions.  Smart spending is what did it for them, and saving everything possible is what got them where they are.  They are all normal people who did what most people find impossible, they worked for it.  They didn\\'t go to the store unless they HAD to, and ONLY bought what they HAD to, nothing more.  I am sorry to say that it really is just that simple.',\n   \"I would recommend the Wealth Barber.

Linguistically, the word fire refers to the combination of the brilliant glow and large amount of heat released during a rapid, self-sustaining burning of combustible fuel. Technically, fire is not a state of matter; it is an exothermic oxidation process by which heat and light energy are given out. Fire starts when a fuel with adequate oxygen supply is subjected to enough heat, and it is sustained by the further release of heat energy in the process, as well as a continuous supply of oxygen and combustible fuel',\n   \"The short answer is that fire is a chemical reaction that gives off heat.  Even a tiny spark can ignite gasoline fumes if enough (but not too much) is present in air.  Always clean (auto parts?) with gasoline outside for safety.. . Combustion of gasoline (e.g., in an engine) requires the molecules of the fuel to combine with the molecules of oxygen (oxygen atoms cling together two-by-two).  The electrons of the oxygen and fuel molecules possessed far more energy than is needed to hold together the products of combustion and the excess energy is given up as heat.  Because gasoline includes hydrocarbon molecules the fuel provides carbon and hydrogen for combustion and the products of combustiuon are carbon dioxide (and dangerous carbon monoxide with too little air present) plus H2O or water.  A gallon of gas produces about a gallon of water (which you can see as steam out the car's tailpipe on a very cold day).. . Combustion of gasoline is an exothermic reaction giving off enough excess energy to ignite more fuel until it is all used up - if there is enough air.  Burning candles (wax is a hydrocarbon) works the very same way.\",\n   'Because its a Fire ;)',\n   'Because fire is produced by the chemical reaction in wich the carbon in any fuel combines with oxygen and produces carbon dioxide and releases a lot of energy in both infrared and visible spectrum, or simply it releass a lot of energy this energy is in the form of heat and light, heat produces a temperatues rise in the surrounding area and so you feel the heat of the fire, this process itself require heat to start up and once it is started, the heat energy released during the process keeps the process going.. . and how old ae you anyway.'],\n  'answer': 'Fire, a form of combustion, is the most spectacular chemical phenomenon.

When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colours because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight.',\n   'The Earth\\'s sky is blue because the air molecules (largely nitrogen. and oxygen) are much smaller than the wavelength of light.  When light. encounters particles much smaller than its wavelength, the scattered. intensity is inversely proportional to the 4\\'th power of the. wavelength.  This is called \"Rayleigh scattering,\" and it means that. half the wavelength is scattered with 2**4 = 16 times more intensity.. That\\'s why the sky appears blue: the blue light is scattered some 16. times more strongly than the red light.  Rayleigh scattering is also. the reason why the setting Sun appears red: the blue light has been. scattered away from the direct sunlight..  . Thus, if the atmosphere of another planet is composed of a transparent. gas or gases whose molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of. light, we would, in general, also expect the sky on that planet to. have a blue color..  . If you want another color of the sky, you need bigger particles in the. air.  You need something bigger than molecules in the air---dust..  . Dust particles can be many times larger than air molecules but still. small enough to not fall out to the ground.  If the dust particles are. much larger than the wavelength of light, the scattered light will be. neutral in color (i.e., white or gray)---this also happens in clouds. here on Earth, which consist of water droplets.  If the dust particles. are of approximately the same size as the wavelength of light, the. situation gets complex, and all sorts of interesting scattering. phenomena may happen.  This happens here on Earth from time to time,. particularly in desert areas, where the sky may appear white, brown,. or some other color.  Dust is also responsible for the pinkish sky on. Mars, as seen in the photographs returned from the Viking landers..  . If the atmosphere contains lots of dust, the direct light from the Sun. or Moon may occasionally get some quite unusual color.  Sometimes,. green and blue moons have been reported.  These phenomena are quite. rare though---they happen only \"once in a blue moon....\"  :) The dust. responsible for these unusual color phenomena is most often volcanic. in origin.  When El Chicon erupted in 1982, this caused unusually. strongly colored sunsets in equatorial areas for more than one year.. The much bigger volcanic explosion at Krakatoa, some 110 years ago,. caused green and blue moons worldwide for a few years..  . One possible exception to the above discussion is if the clouds on the. planet are composed of a strongly colored chemical.  This might occur. on Jupiter, where the clouds are thought to contain sulfur, phosphorus,. and/or various organic chemicals..  . It\\'s also worth pointing out that the light of the planet\\'s primary is. quite insignificant.  Our eyes are highly adaptable to the dominating. illumination and perceive it as \"white,\" within a quite wide range of. possible colors.  During daytime, we perceive the light from the Sun. (6000 K) as white, and at night we perceive the light from our. incandescent lamps (2800 K, like a late, cool M star) as white.  Only. if we put these two lights side-by-side, at comparable intensities,. will we perceive a clear color difference..  . If the Sun was a hot star (say of spectral type B), it\\'s likely we. still would perceive its light as \"white\" and the sky\\'s color as blue.'],\n  'answer': 'A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.

Netiquette (neologism, a portmanteau formed from \"Internet etiquette\") is a catch-all term for the conventions of politeness recognised on Usenet, in mailing lists, and otheir electronic forums such as internet message boards. These conventions address group phenomena (such as flaming) with changes in personal behaviour, such as not posting in all uppercase, not (cross-)posting to inappropriate groups, refraining from commercial advertising outside the biz groups and not top-posting. RFC 1855 is a fairly lengthy and comprehensive set of such conventions.. . The rules of netiquette are slightly different for newsgroups, web forums and IRC (Internet Relay Chat). For example, on Usenet it is conventional to write in standard English and not use abbreviations such as \"u\" for \"you\" or \"ne1\" for \"anyone\". These abbreviations are more likely to be tolerated on web forums, and are almost universal on IRC where, since discussion is real-time, they serve the practical purpose of speeding the flow of conversation. Many IRC users look down on this form of conversation, though. Issues such as the level of tolerance for off-topic discussion or spoilers may also vary from one newsgroup, forum, or channel to another. The rule of thumb in any of these discussion mediums is to \"lurk before you leap\"—get a feel for the local conventions before diving into conversation and inadvertently embarrassing oneself. Also, read the FAQ if there is one.. . The following is a list of some of the more common rules associated with netiquette on Usenet.. . The most important rule of netiquette is, \"Think before you post\". If what you intend to post will not make a positive contribution to the newsgroup and be of interest to several readers, do not post it! Personal messages to one or two individuals should not be posted to newsgroups, use private e-mail instead. . This is sometimes stated in other forms, such as \"Remember the human\". . When following up on an article, quote the minimum text necessary to give some context to your reply and be careful to attribute the quote to the correct person. If the article to which you are responding was cross-posted to several groups, edit the distribution (\"Newsgroups:\") header to contain only those groups which are appropriate to your reply, especially if the original message was posted to one or more inappropriate groups in the first place. . Re-read and edit your posting carefully before you post. Check the spelling, grammar, and capitalization. Typing in all capital letters usually denotes screaming or yelling. Keep your lines to fewer than 70 characters. Do not post test messages except in their appropriate groups; wait until you have something to say. When posting humorous or sarcastic comments, it is conventional to append an emoticon, but do not overuse them. . Before asking a question, read the messages already in the group and read the group\\'s FAQ if it has one. When you do post a question, follow it with, \"Please reply by mail and I will post a summary if requested,\" and make sure you do post a summary if requested; or, if only a few people were interested, send them a summary by mail.

Materials such as glass, fur and cloth acquire and electric charge by rubbing them egains each other, a process which tears electrons off one substance and attaches it to the other. Electric charges (+) and (-) may also be separated by a chemical process, as in an electric battery.. . Electric Charge. The unit of electric charge is the coulomb. Ordinary matter is made up of atoms which have positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons surrounding them. Charge is quantized as a multiple of the electron or proton charge: . . . . The influence of charges is characterized in terms of the forces between them (Coulomb\\'s law) and the electric field and voltage produced by them. One coulomb of charge is the charge which would flow through a 120 watt lightbulb (120 volts AC) in one second. Two charges of one coulomb each separated by a meter would repel each other with a force of about a million tons!. . The rate of flow of electric charge is called electric current and is measured in amperes. . . In introducing one of the fundamental properties of matter, it is perhaps appropriate to point out that we use simplified sketches and constructs to introduce concepts, and there is inevitably much more to the story. No significance should be attached to the circles representing the proton and electron, in the sense of implying a relative size, or even that they are hard sphere objects, although that\\'s a useful first construct. The most important opening idea, electrically, is that they have a property called \"charge\" which is the same size, but opposite in polarity for the proton and electron. The proton has 1836 times the mass of the electron, but exactly the same size charge, only positive rather than negative. Even the terms \"positive\" and \"negative\" are arbitrary, but well-entrenched historical labels. The essential implication of that is that the proton and electron will strongly attract each other, the historical archtype of the cliche \"opposites attract\". Two protons or two electrons would strongly repel each other. Once you have established those basic ideas about electricity, \"like charges repel and unlike charges attract\", then you have the foundation for electricity and can build from there.. . From the precise electrical neutrality of bulk matter as well as from detailed microscopic experiments, we know that the proton and electron have the same magnitude of charge. All charges observed in nature are multiples of these fundamental charges. Although the standard model of the proton depicts it as being made up of fractionally charged particles called quarks, those fractional charges are not observed in isolation -- always in combinations which produce +/- the electron charge.. . An isolated single charge can be called an \"electric monopole\". Equal positive and negative charges placed close to each other constitute an electric dipole. Two oppositely directed dipoles close to each other are called an electric quadrupole. You can continue this process to any number of poles, but dipoles and quadrupoles are mentioned here because they find significant application in physical phenomena. . . One of the fundamental symmetries of nature is the conservation of electric charge. No known physical process produces a net change in electric charge',\n   'Electric charge is a fundamental conserved property of some subatomic particles, which determines their electromagnetic interactions.',\n   'Electric charge is a fundamental conserved property of some subatomic particles, which determines their electromagnetic interactions.

Most people are never going to be at peace.',\n   'WELL ... YOU ASKED ... and here it is:. . This year’s visit of the Dalai Lama to Portland brought about renewed discussion, especially with young people, of peace and how to achieve it. The Dalai Lama’s commitment to non-violence and compassion is an ideal that more and more Americans are inspired by. . How can we help our children practice these qualities and begin to experience: compassion and understanding - rather than blame; forgiveness \\xad rather than retaliation; active calm - rather than anger or passive victim-consciousness?. . Of course, the first and best way to teach anything is to model it yourself. When someone cuts in front of you in traffic or honks at you if you hesitate, do you mutter an epithet or react with fear? Or do you cheerfully say, “Go ahead, I hope you make it safely!” Can you perhaps comment with compassion to your child, “Imagine being so tense and unhappy.”. . Understanding that 1) that the impatience and anger of others is coming from their own lack of inner peace, and 2) that theirs is a vortex of blaming, negative energy that you can enter or not, by your own choice, is a huge step toward living in peace and non-violence. It may be asking too much of most children that they see this when the negativity is coming from another child toward them personally. Yet if they live in a home where the parent has modeled this understanding when tested through neighbors, co-workers, and even their own family members, they eventually gain the maturity to see this truth in their own lives.. . When I was a classroom teacher I had many opportunities to observe the difference it makes when a family supports this point of view of conflict. I have had students who had a disagreement outside the classroom where the parents took their own child’s side with no attempt to understand or forgive the other child’s shortcomings. . . In one incident, two students had a misunderstanding that spilled over into the parents’ world. One parent, perhaps feeling inadequate and defensive, became angry. This family dealt with the situation with anger, blame, and feelings of insult and indignation. . . Of course their daughter stopped playing with or speaking to the other child. . . The other family, while supporting their daughter, discussed how their intentions could had been so misinterpreted and how to make the other family feel better. In the end, they realized the best thing to do was forgive and say nothing while keeping the family in their prayers.. .  The daughter of the first family often had emotional blocks at school, where she could not overcome disappointment or her own mistakes. The other girl was almost always happy and able to pick herself up after a mistake and try again. A couple of weeks later, I observed the daughter of the family who forgave, happily cheering the other girl on in a contest. She was well-adjusted and not living in the thought of their former disagreement at all. Whereas, the girl of the parents determined to be “right” lived in countless contractions of the heart where she could not let others in.. . Discussions about teaching children not to resort to violence often focus on teaching “conflict resolution.” Teaching conflict resolution is an excellent thing and helpful to students who find themselves embroiled in conflict. But I would like to see more attention given to changing the consciousness of children so that so many conflicts don’t even arise. . . Giving children an environment of love and acceptance for all (acceptance does not mean tolerating destructive behavior), modeling kindness and a peaceful heart (sarcasm and much media are enemies of these qualities), and practicing compassion for the reality that negative and angry people must endure, will prevent many conflicts from arising in the first place.',\n   'meditate!!!!',\n   'peace doesnt always mean happiness. just be neutral. lose yourself.',\n   \"Peace starts with each person.

There is fossil record of ancestors of chimps, gorillas, etc.\",\n   \"An entire species does not evolve. Two things are required for evolution geographic isolation and environmental stress. To simplify it, a group of ancestral primates, let's call them proto-monkeys is living happily in the forest. They have no predators and have over populated the area to the point where there is not enough food to support the existing population. So rather than starve they spread out in search of food. Some are able to find food in the grasslands, they survive, but do not thrive; some do better than others. So find food in the mountains, they survive, but do not thrive; some do better than others. Those that do better than others have more mating oppertunities and pass their genes on to the next generation. Those that don't do so well, don't pass their genes on. Random mistakes are often made in DNA deplication, sometimes they are fatal, sometimes they give an advantage and sometime they don't make a difference. Because these mistakes are random they will vary in geographically isoloated populations. The plains monkeys have become taller because the shorter ones could not see predators over the grass and were all eaten and did not pass on their genes. The mountain monkeys have become hairy because those with less hair all froze to death and did not pass on their genes. But nothing has changed in the habitat of the original population of proto-monkeys. If there is no change to cause environmental stress a species will not change to try and balance out the stress. These 3 populations of proto-monkeys could interact, but they are happy where they are, and if there is no environmental stress there is no reason to leave your habitat. Gradually over time the populations become so different they are no longer the same species.

Exercises for your back and abs can help prevent it in the future.\",\n   'HEAT PADS, EXERCISE AND REST CAN HELP.PLEASE READ BELOW SITES.',\n   \"* The treatment program for mechanical LBP must have specific functional goals and can be outlined in the following 6 steps:. .          1. Control of pain and the inflammatory process. .             Pain treatment should be initiated early and efficiently to gain control. Ice, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and relative rest may help with controlling the pain and the inflammatory process. Excessive bedrest, however, may be detrimental by leading to lumbar segment motion, loss of muscle strength, and general deconditioning with blunting of motivation.. .          2. Restoration of joint ROM and soft-tissue extensibility. .             Extension exercises may reduce neural tension. Flexion exercises reduce articular weight-bearing stress to the facet joints and stretch the dorsolumbar fascia. The use of ultrasound may improve collagen extensibility.. .          3. Improvement of muscular strength and endurance. .             Exercise training can begin after the patient has passed successfully through the pain control phase. The key is to attain adequate musculoligamentous control of lumbar spine forces to minimize the risk of repetitive injury to the intervertebral discs, facet joints, and surrounding structures. Start with isometrics, then progress to isotonic exercises with effort directed at concentric strengthening.. .          4. Coordination retraining. .             Dynamic exercise in a structured training program maximizes coordinated muscle group activities that lead to postural control and the fusion of muscle control with spine stability.. .          5. Improvement of general cardiovascular condition. .             Patients are encouraged to remain active and initiate brisk walking programs, aquatic activities, or use of stationary bicycles/stair steppers. These activities can increase endorphin levels, promoting a sense of well-being, and allow the patient to perform at a higher level of function before perceiving pain.. .          6. Maintenance exercise programs. .             A home program is developed within the tolerance and ability of the patient in order to encourage continued exercise after discharge from physical therapy.. .       The main goal of physical therapy in acute back pain is not to increase strength, but to achieve adequate pain control. No benefit has been demonstrated for strengthening exercises in acute back pain. Exercise should begin with extension exercises in the prone position after lateral trunk shifts and then progress, as tolerated, to prone lying with support. Flexion exercises can be performed only if no acute dural tension exists.. .       The spine should be stabilized using strengthening of segmental muscles followed by the prime movers of the spine (latissimus dorsi, abdominals, erector spinae). Muscle groups should be strengthened in a neutral position to decrease tension on ligaments and joints; this position allows balanced segmental forces between the discs and the zygapophyseal joints and maximizes functional stability with axial loading.. .       Physical therapy programs also should include positioning the patient to maximize comfort. Loosening of the hamstrings, glutei, gastrocnemius/soleus group, tensor fascia latae, quadriceps group, and hip flexors also contributes to reduction of LBP and effective conditioning. . .

The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing.

Answering it would be very problematic (fodder for litigation, bad feelings, etc.) and would not help anyone -- the employer has already made their decision. . . OTOH, I am typically willing to answer something like, \"What skills should I focus on to be more competitive in the future?\"  Or any of the many similar issues, \"What did you really like about my cover letter/interview/experience/etc?\"  Or even, \"What do you think my weaknesses were as a candidate?\". .

This means there is no amount of action smaller than hbar/2.',\n   'Energy of an object can be in several forms, potential—due to the position of the object relative to other objects; kinetic—energy because of its motion; chemical—due to chemical bonds between atoms that make up the substance; electrical—due to its charge; thermal—due to its heat; and nuclear—due to the instability of the nuclei of its atoms. In the case where the \"object\" is an electromagnetic wave or light, then radiant energy can also be defined.. . One form of energy can be readily transformed into another; for instance, a battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy, which can be converted into thermal energy.

That is the special feature and indeed the purpose, of human form of life. Animals also have intelligence but their intelligence is exercised only for the purpose of procuring food, and for mating and defending. However, human beings have the capacity to inquire and understand the deeper meaning of life. Is there no need to seek the deeper meaning in life? There is a great need to do so. Here are some reasons why. If I don\\'t know the purpose of life or why I exist,. what kind of life is that? An intelligent person naturally asks these questions, \"Where did I come from, where am I going, what is the meaning of all the orderliness in nature I see around, who has made it, why is there suffering?\" A child may believe that a remote-controlled toy car is running by itself, and may accept this as fact, and may have no need to inquire further, but it is not so for a thoughtful adult.. Belief in God is not an excuse made up by people who didn\\'t have any other explanation. This is the view of anthropomorphism, the view of God as a \"creation\". or \"imagination\" of man, conjured up by the wishful thinking of weak-minded individuals. However, if you read some of the writings of the great acaryas you. would realize that they certainly were the opposite of weak-minded. They were scholars of the highest caliber and also men of great character and. accomplishment. Nor were they unsuccessful people who turned to philosophy in frustration; many of them held responsible posts in society and were very. much respected, wealthy, successful and so on. Men of such caliber have pondered over questions of existence, cause and effect and so on and logically arrived at the ultimate conclusion of the cause of all causes --- God.. It is quite possible to come to a completely atheistic or impersonalistic conclusion through such inquiry, as so many modern philosophers and scientists have. done. However, the missing point is that they are trying to understand God and His plans, who is beyond the perception of our mundane senses, through their. own intellectual exercises. Srila Prabhupada often ridiculed the foolishness of this attempt with the story of a well frog trying to understand the Atlantic ocean. in terms of Dr. Frog\\'s well - the only world he knew. The Vedic method is that in order to understand the true picture of things, to get the right answer to these existential questions we discussed above, one must approach those who have already realized the truth. But acceptance of Vedic authority is not blind. sentiment, as many people think. It is very much based on logic and the Vedas are so exactingly scientific. When one makes his/her inquiry in the light of the. intelligence of Vedic authority, then one comes to the undefeatable conclusion - the cause of all causes is a transcendental person, God, Who is the source of. everything (including our selves) and under Whose control everything moves.. Some unscrupulous or uninformed people might have taken advantage of this fact, to explain away their misdeeds, because after all \"without God\\'s sanction. nothing would happen\". However that is not the teaching of these acaryas; the Vedic science very much holds one responsible for one\\'s actions, and one\\'s. freewill, but under the sanction of God. (Please refer to our previous discussions on Freewill.). The bhakti yoga process of devotion to God is simultaneously simple and sublime; it is so effective that even a child can practice it, as can a great scholar. Even. those who do not have very much knowledge of theological aspects may worship the Supreme Lord by simple acts of faith.

As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. . . However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. . . As you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions.

Blood is simple.  It is simply a transfusion of cells.  Your white blood cells are not alerted as they are in the case of organ transplantation.  The reason for blood rejection is actually coagulation that occurs as a result of different blood types being mixed.  There are three different bloot types, A, B and O  B blood types have B receptors and actually have anti-A antigens and A blood types have A receptors and anti-B antigens so if they are mixed, the antigens attatch to the other blood type's receptors causing the cells to clump together and restrict blood flow.  The reason an O blood type is the universal donor is because it contains neither A nor B antigens and so is safe to transmit into another blood type.  So it is the actual red blood cells causing the rejection.  . . On the other hand, your white blood cells attack foreign organs because they recognize them as a foreign object.  There are special types of receptors on your ordinary organs that tell your white blood cells that they are supposed to be there, and therefore your cells don't attack.  There are multiple factors that control this, so it is possible to find a closer match with some receptors in common so the effect is not as severe, but unless you receive the organ from a twin, it is near impossible, so you must always be on some kind of immuno-suppressant to prevent your white blood cells from attacking the organ.\",\n   \"as far as i understand there really isn't much genetic material in blood and therefore it is not necessary to get a more detailed match.  we all have pretty much the same blood.  but i do think that if you get the wrong blood type it causes a similar reaction as rejecting an organ.  organs do have genetic material and therefore are person specific.  and therefore the matching is much more complicated.\"],\n  'answer': 'Most blood transfusions are of packed red cells and not serum/platelets or white cells.

It is more likely that the Iraq invading Kuwait scenario would fall under that assumption.. I think that the US government has come to a conclusion that we are on the verge of a war of religions, or more likely ideologies. It would be presumptuous to try and determent a one cause to the coming war. . I think that the world wide spread of the media with its many forms (Cable, Satellite, Internet, etc.)  have pushed the Moslem regimes to the extreme, fearing that secularity and democratic influence is penetrating their country and will result in an up raising against them. One of the best way to maintain the power that you have and even gain more of it, is by hatred. When the common man is occupied hating an outside enemy, its hatred is kept out side the county and would not be directed towards the regime. . So- I believe that the US understands that the fanatic Moslem regimes have already started a war on the democratic world and now is the time to try a fight it.. . So why invade Iraq? Because it is a huge, week Moslem country that thought to be easy to defeat. . This is exactly the same reason why Afghanistan was first and Syria is next in line.',\n  'I think Yuval is pretty spot on. It\\'s a proving ground and a focal point for terror activity that\\'s not on American soil.
